# TradingSim
#### Description:
TradingSim is a web app that allows users to simulate and practice real-time stock portfolio management with no risk and no monetary commitment. The stocks are real companies listed on stock exchanges, and the stock prices are updated in real time using a Yahoo Finance API. Users of TradingSim can buy, sell, and quote stocks by searching the stock ticker. Each user is given $10,000 to start (not real currency, only for simulation purposes).
